For this portfolio I used Bootstrap to apply a style sheet, applicable textboxes and a responsive navbar and used 3 html files
to create a webpage that is connected to a bio, contact sheet, and portfolio page. 
The portfolio page contains links to my social media and the bandcamp webpage for the band I used to play in.
The bio page contains an image of me playing hockey and a short summary of my life.
The contact sheet contains text boxes asking for name, email, and messages.
